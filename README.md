REMINISCENCE - Share your thoughts!

This app allows elder people to insert, read and share their memories. 
It is intended to provide help reminding events people have lived.
They can add memories, view them among other memories and suggestions provided by the system, and stay in touch with friends by friendship and "memory tagging"
